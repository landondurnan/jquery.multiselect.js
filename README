# jquery.multiselect.js #

This jQuery plugin allows you to restyle the output of a select menu that allows multiple choices into a more user-friendly interface.  Each optgroup is broken down into categories that can be drilled down.  The plugin provides functionality to select / deselect entire optgroups and individual options.  The users selected options are moved to a separate presentational list for easy viewing and maintenance.
